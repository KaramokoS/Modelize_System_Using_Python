# Readme

> The aim of these notebooks is to propose a pipeline of learning for modelizing a system using python.
I recommend to explore notebooks in the following order:
> - Explore `numpy` library. Learn the way `numpy` stores data, slicing, broadcasting,...
> - `sympy` for symbolic computation
>- `matplotlib` for visualization
>- `scipy` in different notebooks : `equation_solving.ipynb`, `interpolation.ipynb`,...
>- See application on Partial Different Equations (PDEs).

I use FeniCSx to solve heat diffusion problem, which is the main subject of this git repo

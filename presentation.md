# Introduction
As engineer I'm interested to understand how heat difuse through a wall. After a state of art study, I find Python to be the best solution for my purpose. for Next reason:
- Libs are open source
- A big community 
- could be interfaced with compiled languages (C/C++)  
**So let's see where I'm with my project**

# Basics
Let's dig little into basics libs for scientific camputation

## Numpy

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python:


## Sympy

## Scipy

## Matplotlib

---
# Some application

## equation solving

## interpolation

## optimization

## Patial Differential Equation
---
# First Draft of my project

---
# Interfacing python with C++

## Usage of swigg

```{r, cars, fig.cap="A scatterplot.", echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
